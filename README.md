This project aims to predict the molecular weight of different compounds using regression models. So far, a manual linear regression model and a neural network (relu and linear activations) using Nabayan Saha's

Initially, a manually made linear regression model was used, and was more recently updated to include a small neural network made using Tensorflow and Keras libraries and ReLU and linear activations.
